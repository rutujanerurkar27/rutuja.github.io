# Rutuja Nerurkar 
I am a disciplined and passionate individual who is eager to hike my research skills and utilize them to improve healthcare using ubiquitous computing.

### Research experience and projects 
I have been working in the industry as an AI developer for past 3+ years. My areas of working is maininly machine learning and deep learning. I am mainly into researching computaional biology solutions.

### Independent projects:- 
Following are indepent research projects which I have worked on in the past as well as present:-
1. Chronic kidney disease detection(I am currently actively working on completing this project):- 
I have worked on creating a machine learning model which predicts CKD in the early stages by using the least available features. The model that I built uses patients urine and blood test result and gives the CKD prediction. This project is still in progress. I am currently working on performing the module for conducting the urine test and blood test using a smartphone so that the user can use the application at their convenience.

2. Tic Tac Toe human vs computer :- This is a gaming application developed in Java to play Tic Tac Toe between computer and a normal player.

Following is my work experience at Sapient Shopping, Inc:-

1. Weapons and objects detection using deep learning:- This is a security application in which detects weapons such as rifles, hand guns, tanks etc, along with other objects such as vehicles, human beings, animals, etc to generate an Amber alert to  stakeholders when a weapon is detected. The accuracy of detection is 99.8% While working on this application I built and trained models to detect various different objects (armed people, rifle, shotgun, machine gun, tanks, etc) in the streaming video (DJI drone).

2. Stroke and fibrillation detection(using rPPG):- A health care application developed by using deep learning for stroke and fibrillation detection to predict heart stroke occured in the past and prediction for future using various facial parameters. Heart rate monitor (EKG monitor) is developed using two methods, the first approach is using deep learning in which I used a camera device i.e. a person's face through a camera and is fed to the fibrillation detection algorithm.

3. Fall Detection:- This is also a health care application in which I collected the sensor data using two accelerometer based devices such as android phone, movesense smart device and after gathering the sensor data it is fed to an algorithm to predict if the person has fallen and generate an emergency SOS call. The accuracy of fall detection is 98%.

4. Body vitals detection(using PPG):- This is an android application which detects body vitals and it uses the concepts of PPG which takes the input from the smartphoneâ€™s flashlight and performs extensive image processing to calculate heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and blood oxygen(spo2). The accuracy of the values in the algorithm is 97%~98% and the testing was run against the Oxymeters, Apple watch and Samsung Galaxy watches.

5. AI Agents:- It is an AI agent that connects to the fitness watches (Fitbit, Samsung, Apple, Movesense, etc) to retrieve the health statistics to be used for detecting heart diseases and providing them the right type of medication.
